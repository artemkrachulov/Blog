Everybody sometimes said to yourself: If I did this or that much earlier, maybe now all would be different. And I'm not an exception. As an independent programmer after a certain number of years of experience and obtained knowledge, I will try to write 7 basic tips for beginners that would help you become better, than you have now. Let's go.

## 1. Sign up for a few freelance markets.

If you decide to become a programmer and work remotely, the easiest way to find a job is to use the freelance market. With high probability, you will do so. But do not stop with one market. Their exist a great number: beginning from those that open the door for programmers with a minimum experience ([Upwork](https://www.upwork.com), [Elance](https://www.elance.com/), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/), etc.) and ending with those who hire only professionals ([TopTal](http://www.toptal.com/), [Gun.io](https://gun.io/), etc.). Accordingly, they are all have different levels of rates and the prices of contracts. You start with a small, but give yourself a goal: "To work, grow and eventually work with professionals in the same team.".

**What you need to do**

* Sign up not only on one market (for 3 or 4)
* To set a goal to join the team to the pros

**What you will get?**

## 2. Sign up in the social network LinkedIn

Your life is not just a job that brings you pleasure, money and experience. But as well as learning, certification and recommendations. Usually people write this information in own resume, do not should not be limited only with him. You must have an CV in the public internet access. Yout oDesk or Elance profiles that strictly focused on your work direction is not enough. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) gives you this opportunity. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) - the social network to find and establish business contacts. Every time [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) involves more and more people from all the world. It turns into a global index card. Many agencies, recruiters, firms first make themselves profile there. They often placed job vacancies, confirm skills, create a group to solve a particular problem, discuss the news, and much more.

**What you need to do**

* Register your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) profile as soon as possible

**What you will get?**

* Moving to another country, hiring agencies are watch you profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)
* You will receive an excellent CV that will help you to increase your rate

## 3. Read programming books

It's certainly not a secret, but perhaps the most important thing in this list, and I want to make focus on that! In addition to the profile literature, with which you will read to to get information about your programming direction (I am didn't read books. I watched a video tutorials). You need to read the minimum set of books written by programmers for programmers. The knowledge that you get from these books will allocate you from the great mass of existing programmers. You'll find the answers to many questions that you not asked yourself yet. But soon this time will come and you must be prepared for this. That's the most basic set of books:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
        <div class="row col-space_15">
            <div class="col-sm-6"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img" src="http://www.artemkrachulov.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/design-patterns-elements-of-reusable-object-oriented-software.jpg" alt="Design patterns: Elements of reusable object oriented software" style="max-width:100%;"></div></div>
            <div class="col-sm-6"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img" src="http://www.artemkrachulov.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/refactoring-improving-the-design-of-existing-code.jpg" alt="Рrefactoring. Improving the design of existing code" style="max-width:100%;"></div></div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
        <div class="row col-space_15">
            <div class="col-sm-6"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img" src="http://www.artemkrachulov.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/head-first-design-patterns.jpg" alt="Head first. Design patterns" style="max-width:100%;"></div></div>
            <div class="col-sm-6"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img" src="http://www.artemkrachulov.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/code-complete.jpg" alt="Code complete" style="max-width:100%;"></div></div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

It is probable that you do not understand all the information after reading the book only once, so I advise you to re-read from time to time, these books and add new ones. Do not regret spent time and you get invaluable knowledge.

**What you need to do**

* Read different programming books, especially those I showed above

**What you will get?**

* Increasing professional vocabulary
* Changing your thinking
* More efficient using of your time
* Your code would be more perfect
* You will be give advice and counseling to less experienced programmers and employers. This is a huge plus

## 4. Sign up on Github

Sooner or later you will have to place your code in the public access. Let it be sooner. Code - it's like face of developer, it should be always clean, neat and accurate. But how a potential customer will check that? Your code good or bad? Will another programmer understand your code? You have to show how your code is look like. For this purpose and not only for that use [Github](https://github.com/). You can place you code snippets, projects that you want to share. Keep a more active commit history, get stars. We live in a time when representative profile on [Github](https://github.com/) is a condition of good employment.

**What you need to do**

**What you will get?**

* Reputation

## 5. Sign up on Stack Overflow

Yes Yes. Many developers are just looking for answers to their questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) service, but it's not just a question-and-answer service. It is a powerful tool in the right hands. Try to answer the questions themselves, even if not the most complex question. After all, on a level with [Github](https://github.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) began to appear in the list of mandatory requirements of large companies that are looking for professionals and are willing to pay good money.

## 6. Create a personal website

It must be, if not the most beautiful and fancy. Register a domain name that corresponds to your name or abbreviation. Accomodate links to your profile, where you spend a social and professional activity. Write a blog articles, share your work and achievements. It is not difficult how it may seem. If you work for yourself, it is not necessary to create fake agencies, in which will work only you. Improve yourself! Add your name to your projects.

**What you need to do**

* Engage in promotion of own name
* Write a blog articles

**What you will get?**

## 7. Keep other social activities

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Facebook](www.facebook.com/‎), [Google+](https://plus.google.com), too, can become your assistants. Very often, people will find you on these social services. If you find an interesting article, news or other useful information, do not be lazy and share it with others. This is done in one click, as a lot of sites have share tools.

 **What you need to do**

* To share different information with others

**What you will get?**

* More and more people will know about you

Perhaps it's all the tips that I'd be happy to hear, when was beginner. But the time has not come back. I hope this information helps programmers who want to achieve maximum results in a short period of time.
