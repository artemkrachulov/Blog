Image cropping plugin for iOS devices with support for landscape and portrait orientation. Cropper view allows to specify the location and size of the crop rectangle. Easy to set up. Has many settings for flexible integration into your project. The plugin is written in Swift.

**Features:**

* Easy to setup and integrate
* Crop rectangle animation (show / dismiss)
* Full image resolution
* Zoom and scroll
* Translation to landscape or portrait orientation
* Ð¡olor customization
* Ability to draw custom crop rectangle
* Drag, Scroll, Zoom callback methods
* Changing crop rectangle callback method

## Usage

### Storyboard

```swift
@IBOutlet weak var cropView: AKImageCropperView!

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    cropView.image = UIImage(named: "yourImage")
}

override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() {
    super.viewWillLayoutSubviews()

    // Refreshing
    cropView.refresh()
}
```

### Programmatically

```swift
var cropView: AKImageCropperView!

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    let image = UIImage(named: "yourImage")
    let frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 300, 300)
    cropView = AKImageCropperView(frame: frame, image: image, showOverlayView: false)

    view.addSubview(cropView)
}

override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() {
    super.viewWillLayoutSubviews()

    // Refreshing
    cropView.refresh()
}
```

## Initializing

```swift
func init(frame: CGRect, image: UIImage, showOverlayView: Bool)
```

| Parameter       | Description    |
| :-------------- | :------------- |
| frame           | The frame rectangle for the Cropper view, measured in points. The origin of the frame is relative to the superview in which you plan to add it. |
| image           | The image you want to crop. |
| showOverlayView | Pass `true` to show Overlay view with crop rectangle on initialization. |

Initializes and returns a newly allocated Cropper view object with the specified frame rectangle, image to crop and Overlay view show / hide on initialization flag.

```swift
func init(image: UIImage, showOverlayView: Bool)
```

| Parameter       | Description    |
| :-------------- | :------------- |

```swift
var imageView: UIImageView! {get}
```

### Crop rectangle

```swift
var cropRect: CGRect {get}
```

Returns crop rectangle, measured in points. If Overlay view is active value returns crop rectangle located on the Overlay view, if not - crop rectangle will have size that eaual of scroll view and `CGPointZero` origin coordinates.

```swift
var cropRectTranslatedToImage: CGRect {get}
```

Returns crop rectangle `cropRect` translated to image with scroll view scale factor.

```swift
var cropRectMinSize: CGSize
```

The initial value of this property is `30` pixels width and `30` pixels height.

```swift
var scrollView: AKImageCropperScollView! {get}
```

Returns scroll view object as `UIScrollView` subclass. `UIScrollViewDelegate` protocol can be extended in your view controller.

### Configuring Overlay animation

The initial value of this property is `300` milliseconds.

```swift

The initial value of this property is `CurveLinear`.

### Configuring Overlay view

```swift
var fingerSize: CGFloat

//     __ __ __ __ Cropper View __ __
//    |
//    |      __ __ __ __ Scroll View __ __
//    |     |
//    |<--->| -- Offset fingerSize / 2
//    |     |
//    |<---- ----> -- Finger touch size "fingerSize"
//    |     |
```

A size width of finger touch. This value used to calculate a size of the outer offset for Scroll view when Overlay view will active.
The initial value of this property is `30` pixels.

```swift
var cornerOffset: Int
```

The distance to which will be offset corners of the crop rectangle.
The initial value of this property is `3` pixels.

```swift
var cornerSize: Int
```

The size of the crop rectangle corner.
The initial value of this property is `18` pixels width and `18` pixels height.

```swift
var grid: Bool
```

A Boolean value that determines whether the lines inside the crop rectangle will be shown.
The initial value of this property is `true`.

```swift
var gridLines: Int
```

The number of vertical and horizontal lines inside the crop rectangle.
The initial value of this property is `2` (`2` vertical and `2` horizontal lines).

```swift
var overlayColor: UIColor
```

Overlay view background color.
The initial value of this property is `UIColor(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0, alpha: 0.5)` (Black with 50% alpha).

```swift
var strokeColor: UIColor
```

The color of the outer crop rectangle line.
The initial value of this property is `UIColor(red: 1, green: 1, blue: 1, alpha: 1)` (White).

```swift
var cornerColor: UIColor
```

The color of the corners of the crop rectangle.
The initial value of this property is `UIColor(red: 1, green: 1, blue: 1, alpha: 1)` (White).
